# SwiftUiLearningPlayground

In this repository, you will find a collection of artifacts crafted during my dedicated journey through various SwitfUI Views and Modifiers, as part of my non-obligatory preparation for my internship. <br>
I partly followed the tutorial series "SwiftUI Bootcamp", "SwiftUI Continued Learning", "SwiftUI Advanced Learning" from [Swiftful Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking/playlists). <br>
This repository also acts as data storage and to present the my completed work.
